    "text": "I've always had plenty of pride. But as I look back I'm beginning to realize that a lot of the things I've taken pride in don't exist anymore. There's a rule I plan to follow from now on which comes from this observation: *Take pride in my virtues rather than the superficial circumstances they emerge from*.\n\nMany of the things that I took pride in, and therefore defined me, were part of my high school persona. I took great pride in holding student government and club officer positions to the point where I associated the definition of myself with these things. Now they're gone and I'm realizing that it was a mistake. I have no regret in cherishing these things, but the way in which I took pride in them left me with little to take pride in later in time. I should have taken pride in the traits that emerged from these experiences rather than the titles and superficial importance.\n\nWhat I mean to say is that there's an inclination to perceive the important parts of yourself as those that are most immediately relevant to your life. These things aren't always the ones that will stick around, which exposes a vulnerability if you are prideful of them. For example, think about the things that you take pride in and they may include job positions, educational prestige, and specific ranks amongst different communities. These are all types of things which we mention to others when we're explaining who we are, and they also happen to be the things which likely won't define who we are years or decades from now. So then why do we take pride in them if they are not strongly attached to future versions of ourselves? I think that it is much more rewarding and true to ourselves to instead take pride in the traits & virtues which are exemplified by these short-term compositions of ourselves. In my case student government was my source of pride, but what I should have taken pride in was the loyalty and commitment to hard work that this title was an exemplification of. These are still traits which I carry along with me even though the titles that I associated them with are nonexistent.\n\nSo, I find that it's important to ask yourself *what* you take pride in and more importantly *why* you take pride in it. I think it's likely that the *why* part of the question will turn out to be a more fulfilling source of pride. The titles that define us today may be important now, but it's their virtues which they exemplify that will be remembered further down the lane"

    "summary": "My expectations for what it takes to come up with an innovative idea have lowered. What I used to think was a domain exclusive to geniuses is something I now consider to be approachable by a wider selection of problem solvers. And there's something that a lot of us have in common with these problem solvers: we can tell when something sucks. So why not get more people to try making those things better?",
    "text": "All things suck until they get better. But where do better ideas come from?\n\nI used to think that the people who come up with successfully innovative ideas must have some sort of wildly superior intelligence. Almost as if there was a gold mine of innovative ideas exclusive to those with the intelligence to think it. I no longer believe it works that way. In fact, I think the barrier to entry for ideas that can touch the world in meaningful ways is much lower than most expect. Not to say that the barrier to entry is particularly low, but that it's lower than typically thought.\n\nRather than innovations being generated through the mental capacity of incredibly intelligent engineers, I think it's more likely that innovations are brought to this world by those who are able to act on their intolerance to things that suck. Uber was a response to the outdated structure of taxi cabs. Airbnb saw that booking a hotel shouldn’t be necessary for certain types of trips. Soylent saw that preparing healthy meals is a hassle. Soundcloud saw that sharing personally made music was difficult. The list goes on and on between startups that share a basic similarity- *their innovations are reactions to things that many people know suck*. It’s a simple and obvious thought that gets buried underneath our admiration for these companies that grow impressively from that definition. Innovations are not tirelessly researched formulas from a talented genius as much as they are fed up problem solvers who iterate on something that sucks until it doesn’t suck anymore.\n\nOf course, it takes some brain to realize why and how certain things suck. It also takes plenty of creativity and drive to come up with things that suck less. The point is that if you can realize something sucks (and it isn’t always obvious) then you've already acknowledged a domain in which the world can be improved. The next part is thinking of a solution and executing, which is a whole different ordeal but one that surely isn't being sought after by as many people as there should be.\n\nI also happen to think that people who are professionals in certain domains will end up finding it difficult to think outside the box of assumptions in their field. Being a professional at something means that you are superbly familiar and experienced with the current available knowledge of your subject. Being attached to a fixed size of information makes it difficult to imagine how the realm of potential understanding can actually be much larger than it currently is. An example of this would be self driving cars. All the traditional automobile companies are breaking a sweat to compete with the companies that saw the vehicle as not just a car but as a computer. This also implies that interdisciplinary knowledge is particularly valuable in innovation. When you specialize in something you may be training yourself to be extremely skilled but at the cost of treating your practice as immutable. It takes a fresh mind that can combine a realm of knowledge with a totally different one in order to make the really impressive improvements in the world. This is a reason why ''software is eating the world', and it's also why [Leonardo da Vinci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci) was one hell of a renaissance man."
